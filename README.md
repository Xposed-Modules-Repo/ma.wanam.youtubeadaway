# YouTubeAdAway
Xposed module to block YouTube in-video ads and enable background playback on the official YouTube app

Tested against YouTube 17.40.40, but it should support newer updates.
Feel free to raise an issue if a newer YouTube update is not supported, and please make sure you provide your xposed logs.

YouTube videos ad cards are not hidden, and there is not ETA on when it will be supported.
You are more than welcome to contribute with pull requests!
